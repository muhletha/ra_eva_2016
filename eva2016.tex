%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{presentation}{overall-objectives}{Overall Objectives}

It is forecast that the vast majority of Internet connections will be wireless.
The EVA project grasps this opportunity and focus on wireless communication.
EVA tackles challenges related to providing efficient communication in wireless networks and, more generally, in all networks that are not already organized when set up, and consequently need to evolve and spontaneously find a match between application requirements and the environment.
These networks can use opportunistic and/or collaborative communication schemes.
They can evolve through optimization and self-learning techniques.
Every effort is made to ensure that the results provided by EVA have the greatest possible impact through standardization.
The miniaturization and ubiquitous nature of computing devices has opened the way to the deployment of a new generation of wireless (sensor) networks.
These networks are central to the work in EVA, as EVA focuses on such crucial issues as power conservation, connectivity, determinism, reliability and latency.
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments are also be a new key subject, especially for emergency situations (e.g.~after a disaster).
Industrial process automation and environmental monitoring are considered in greater depth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{test1}{Generalities}

EVA inherits its expertise in designing  algorithms and protocols from HiPERCOM2 (e.g. OLSR).
EVA also inherit know-how in modeling, simulation, experimentation and standardization.
Through this know-how and experience, the results obtained are both far-reaching and useful.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:phylayer}{Physical Layer}

We plan to study how advanced physical layers can be used in low-power wireless networks.
For instance, collaborative techniques such as multiple antennas (e.g. the Massive MIMO technology) can improve communication efficiency.   
The idea is to use a massive network densification by drastically increasing the number of sensors in a given area in a Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode with time reversal.
The first period allows the sensors to estimate the channel state and, after time reversal, the second period is to transmit the data sensed.
Other techniques, such as interference cancellation, are also possible.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:wirelessaccess}{Wireless Access}

Medium sharing in wireless systems has received substantial attention throughout the last decade.
HiPERCOM2 has provided models to compare TDMA and CSMA.
HiPERCOM2 has also studied how network nodes must be positioned to optimize the global throughput.

EVA will pursue modeling tasks to compare access protocols, including multi-carrier access, adaptive CSMA (particularly in VANETs), as well as directional and multiple antennas.
There is a strong need for determinism in industrial networks.
The EVA team will focus particularly on scheduled medium access in the context of deterministic industrial networks; this will involve optimizing the joint time slot and channel assignment.
Distributed approaches will be considered, and the EVA team will determine their limits in terms of reliability, latency and throughput.
Furthermore, adaptivity to application or environment changes will be taken into account.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:coex}{Coexistence of Wireless Technologies}

Wireless technologies such as cellular, low-power mesh networks, (Low-Power) WiFi, and Bluetooth (low-energy) can reasonably claim to fit the requirements of the IoT.
Each, however, uses different trade-offs between reliability, energy consumption and throughput.
The EVA team will study the limits of each technology, and will develop clear criteria to evaluate which technology is best suited to a particular set of constraints.

Coexistence between these different technologies (or different deployments of the same technology in a common radio space) is a valid point of concern.

The EVA team aims at studying such coexistence, and, where necessary, propose techniques to improve it.
Where applicable, the techniques will be put forward for standardization.
Multiple technologies can also function in a symbiotic way.

For example, to improve the quality of experience provided to end users, a wireless mesh network can transport sensor and actuator data in place of a cellular network, when and where cellular connectivity is poor.

The EVA team will study how and when different technologies can complement one another.
A specific example of a collaborative approach is Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN).

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:enereff}{Energy-Efficiency and Determinism}

Reducing the energy consumption of low-power wireless devices remains a challenging task.
The overall energy budget of a system can be reduced by using less power-hungry chips, and significant research is being done in that direction. 
Nevertheless, power consumption is mostly influenced by the algorithms and protocols used in low-power wireless devices, since they influence the duty-cycle of the radio.

EVA will search for energy-efficient mechanisms in low-power wireless networks.
One new requirement concerns the ability to predict energy consumption with a high degree of accuracy.
Scheduled communication, such as the one used in the IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH (Time Slotted CHannel Hopping) standard, and by IETF 6TiSCH, allows for a very accurate prediction of the energy consumption of a chip. Power conservation will be a key issue in EVA.

To tackle this issue and match link-layer resources to application needs, EVA's 5-year research program around Energy-Efficiency and Determinism centers around 3 studies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance Bounds of a TSCH network.
        We propose to study a low-power wireless TSCH network as a Networked Control System (NCS), and use results from the NCS literature.
        A large number of publications on NCS, although dealing with wireless systems, consider wireless links to have perfect reliability, and do not consider packet loss.
        Results from these papers can not therefore be applied directly to TSCH networks.
        Instead of following a purely mathematical approach to model the network, we propose to use a non-conventional approach and build an empirical model of a TSCH network.
    \item Distributed Scheduling in TSCH networks.
       Distributed scheduling is attractive due to its scalability and reactivity, but might result in a sub-optimal schedule.
       We continue this research by designing a distributed solution based on control theory, and verify how this solution can satisfy service level agreements in a dynamic environment.
\end{itemize}

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:netdep}{Network Deployment}

Since sensor networks are very often built to monitor geographical areas, sensor deployment is a key issue.
The deployment of the network must ensure full/partial, permanent/intermittent coverage and connectivity.
This technical issue leads to geometrical problems which are unusual in the networking domain.

We can identify two scenarios.
In the first one, sensors are deployed over a given area to guarantee full coverage and connectivity, while minimizing the number of sensor nodes.
In the second one, a network is re-deployed to improve its performance, possibly by increasing the number of points of interest covered, and by ensuring connectivity.
EVA will investigate these two scenarios, as well as centralized and distributed approaches.
The work starts with simple 2D models and will be enriched to take into account more realistic environment: obstacles, walls, 3D, fading. 

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:datgath}{Data Gathering and Dissemination}

A large number of WSN applications mostly do data gathering (a.k.a ``convergecast'').
These applications usually require small delays for the data to reach the gateway node, requiring time consistency across gathered data.
This time consistency is usually achieved by a short gathering period.

In many real WSN deployments, the channel used by the WSN usually encounters perturbations such as jamming, external interferences or noise caused by external sources (e.g.~a polluting source such as a radar) or other coexisting wireless networks (e.g.~WiFi, Bluetooth).
Commercial sensor nodes can communicate on multiple frequencies as specified in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
This reality has given birth to the multichannel communication paradigm in WSNs.

Multichannel WSNs significantly expand the capability of single-channel WSNs by allowing parallel transmissions, and avoiding congestion on channels or performance degradation caused by interfering devices.

In EVA, we will focus on raw data convergecast in multichannel low-power wireless networks.
In this context, we are interested in centralized/distributed algorithms that jointly optimize the channel and time slot assignment used in a data gathering frame.
The limits in terms of reliability, latency and bandwidth will be evaluated.
Adaptivity to additional traffic demands will be improved. 

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:learn}{Self-Learning Networks}

To adapt to varying conditions in the environment and application requirements, the EVA team will investigate self-learning networks.
Machine learning approaches, based on experts and forecasters, will be investigated to predict the quality of the wireless links in a WSN.
This allows the routing protocol to avoid using links exhibiting poor quality and to change the route before a link failure.
Additional applications include where to place the aggregation function in data gathering.
In a content delivery network (CDN), it is very useful to predict the popularity, expressed by the number of solicitations per day, of a multimedia content.
The most popular contents are cached near the end-users to maximize the hit ratio of end-users' requests.
Thus the satisfaction degree of end-users is maximized and the network overhead is minimized. 

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{fondements}{sec:sectrad}{Security Trade-off in Constrained Wireless Networks}

Ensuring security is a {sine qua non} condition for the widespread acceptance and adoption of the IoT, in particular in industrial and military applications.
While the Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) approach is ubiquitous on the traditional Internet, constraints in terms of embedded memory, communication bandwidth and computational power make translating PKI to constrained networks non-trivial.

Two related standardization working groups were created in 2013 to address this issue.
DICE (DTLS In Constrained Environments) is defining a DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) profile that is suitable for IoT applications, using the (Constrained Application Protocol) CoAP protocol.
ACE is standardizing authentication and authorization mechanisms for constrained environments.

The issue is to find the best trade-off between a communication and computation overhead compatible with the limited capacity of sensor nodes and the level of protection required by the application.

\begin{module}{domaine}{dom11}{Generalities}

Wireless networks have become ubiquitous and are an integral part of our daily lives.
These networks are present in many application domains; the most important are detailed in this section.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{domaine}{indproc}{Industrial Process Automation}

Networks in industrial process automation typically perform \textbf{monitoring and control} tasks.
Wired industrial communication networks, such as HART\footnote{Highway Addressable Remote Transducer, \url{http://en.hartcomm.org/}.}, have been around for decades and, being wired, are highly reliable.
Network administrators tempted to ``go wireless'' expect the same reliability.
Reliable process automation networks -- especially when used for control -- often impose stringent latency requirements.
Deterministic wireless networks can be used in critical systems such as control loops, however, the unreliable nature of the wireless medium, coupled with their large scale and ``ad-hoc'' nature raise some of the most important challenges for low-power wireless research over the next 5-10 years.

Through the involvement of team members in standardization activities, the protocols and techniques will be proposed for the standardization process with a view to becoming the \textit{de-facto} standard for wireless industrial process automation.
Besides producing top level research publications and standardization activities, EVA intends this activity to foster further collaborations with industrial partners.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{domaine}{envmon}{Environmental Monitoring}

Today, outdoor WSNs are used to monitor vast rural or semi-rural areas and may be used to detect fires.
Another example is detecting fires in outdoor fuel depots, where the delivery of alarm messages to a monitoring station in an upper-bounded time is of prime importance.
Other applications consist in monitoring the snow melting process in mountains, tracking the quality of water in cities, registering the height of water in pipes to foresee flooding, etc.
These applications lead to a vast number of technical issues: deployment strategies to ensure suitable coverage and good network connectivity, energy efficiency, reliability and latency, etc.

We will work on such applications in an associate team ``REALMS'' comprising members from EVA, the university of Berkeley and the university of Michigan. 

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{domaine}{iot}{The Internet of Things}

The general agreement is that the Internet of Things (IoT) is composed of small, often battery-powered objects which measure and interact with the physical world, and encompasses smart home applications, wearables, smart city and smart plant applications.

The Internet of Things (IoT) has received continuous attention since 2013, and has been a marketing tool for industry giants such as IBM and Cisco, and the focal point of major events such the Consumer Electronics Show and the IETF.
The danger of such exposure is that any under-performance may ultimately disappoint early adopters.

It is absolutely essential to (1) clearly understand the limits and capabilities of the IoT, and (2) develop technologies which enable user expectation to be met.

With the general public becoming increasingly familiar with the term ``Internet of Things'', its definition is broadening to include all devices which can be interacted with from a network, and which do not fall under the generic term of ``computer''.

The EVA team is dedicated to understanding and contributing to the IoT.
In particular, the team will maintain a good understanding of the different technologies at play (Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4, WiFi, cellular), and their trade-offs.
Through scientific publications and other contributions, EVA will help establish which technology best fits which application.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{domaine}{mil}{Military, Energy and Aerospace}

Through the HIPERCOM project, EVA has developed cutting-edge expertise in using wireless networks for military, energy and aerospace applications. 
Wireless networks are a key enabling technology in the application domains, as they allow physical processes to be instrumented (e.g.~the structural health of an airplane) at a granularity not achievable by its wired counterpart.
Using wireless technology in these domains does however raise many technical challenges, including end-to-end latency, energy-efficiency, reliability and Quality of Service (QoS).
Mobility is often an additional constraint in energy and military applications.
Achieving scalability is of paramount importance for tactical military networks, and, albeit to a lesser degree, for power plants.
EVA will work in this domain.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{domaine}{smacit}{Smart Cities}

It has been estimated that by 2030, 60\% of the world's population will live in cities.
On the one hand, smart cities aim at making everyday life more attractive and pleasant for citizens; on the other hand, they facilitate how those citizens can participate in the life of the city.

Smart cities share the constraint of mobility (both pedestrian and vehicular) with tactical military networks.
Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) will play an important role in the development of smarter cities.

The coexistence of different networks operating in the same radio spectrum can cause interference that should be avoided.
Cognitive radio provides secondary users with the frequency channels that are temporarily unused (or unassigned) by primary users.
Such opportunistic behavior can also be applied to urban wireless sensor networks.
Smart cities raise the problem of transmitting, gathering, processing and storing big data.
Another issue is to provide the right information at the place where it is most needed.

\end{module}

%==============================================================================
\begin{module}{domaine}{emerapp}{Emergency Applications}

In an ``emergency'' application, heterogeneous nodes of a wireless network cooperate to recover from a disruptive event in a timely fashion, thereby possibly saving human lives.
These wireless networks can be rapidly deployed and are useful to assess damage and take initial decisions.
Their primary goal is to maintain connectivity with the humans or mobile robots (possibly in a hostile environment) in charge of network deployment. 
The deployment should ensure the coverage of particular points or areas of interest.
The wireless network has to cope with pedestrian mobility and robot/vehicle mobility.
The environment, initially unknown, is progressively discovered and may contain numerous obstacles that should be avoided.
The nodes of the wireless network are usually battery-powered.
Since they are placed by a robot or a human, their weight is very limited.
The protocols supported by these nodes should be energy-efficient to maximize network lifetime.
In such a challenging environment, sensor nodes should be replaced before their batteries are depleted.
It is therefore important to be able to accurately determine the battery lifetime of these nodes, enabling predictive maintenance.

%\subsection{Node activity scheduling and routing in Wireless Sensor Networks}
%
%\begin{participants}
%    \pers{C\'edric}{Adjih}
%    \pers{Pascale}{Minet}
%\end{participants}
%
%The need to maximize network lifetime in wireless ad hoc networks and especially in wireless sensor networks requires the use of energy efficient algorithms and protocols. Motivated by the fact that a node consumes the least energy when its radio is in sleep state, we achieve energy efficiency by scheduling nodes activity. Nodes are assigned time slots during which they can transmit and they can turn off their radio when they are neither transmitting nor receiving. Compared to classical TDMA-based medium access scheme, spatial bandwidth use is optimized: non interfering nodes are able to share the same time slots, collisions are avoided and overhearing and interferences are reduced. 
%
%In 2014, we study the issue of delay optimization and energy efficiency in grid wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We focus on STDMA (Spatial Reuse TDMA)) scheduling, where a predefined cycle is repeated, and where each node has fixed transmission opportunities during specific slots (defined by colors). We assume a STDMA algorithm that takes advantage of the regularity of grid topology to also provide a spatially periodic coloring (``tiling'' of the same color pattern). In this setting, the key challenges are: 1) minimizing the average routing delay by ordering the slots in the cycle 2) being energy efficient. Our work follows two directions: first, the baseline performance is evaluated when nothing specific is done and the colors are randomly ordered in the STDMA cycle. Then, we propose a solution, ORCHID that deliberately constructs an efficient STDMA schedule. It proceeds in two steps. In the first step, ORCHID starts form a colored grid and builds a hierarchical routing based on these colors. In the second step, ORCHID builds a color ordering, by considering jointly both routing and scheduling so as to ensure that any node will reach a sink in a single STDMA cycle. We study the performance of these solutions by means of simulations and modeling. Results show the excellent performance of ORCHID in terms of delays and energy compared to a shortest path routing that uses the delay as a heuristic. We also present the adaptation of ORCHID to general networks under the SINR interference model.

%Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a major role in industrial environments for data gathering (convergecast). 
%Among the industrial requirements, we can name a few like 1) determinism and bounded convergecast latencies, 2) throughput and 3) robustness against interferences.
%The classical IEEE~802.15.4 that has been designed for low power lossy networks (LLNs) partially meets these requirements. That is why the IEEE~802.15.4e MAC amendment
%has been proposed recently. This amendment combines a slotted medium access with a channel hopping (i.e. Time Slotted Channel Hopping TSCH). The MAC layer orchestrates the medium accesses of nodes according to a given schedule. Nevertheless, this amendment does not specify how this schedule is computed. We propose a distributed joint time slot and channel assignment, called $Wave$ for data gathering in LLNs. This schedule targets minimized data convergecast delays by reducing the number of slots assigned to nodes. Moreover, $Wave$ ensures the absence of conflicting transmissions in the schedule provided. In such a schedule, a node is awake only during its slots and the slots of its children in the convergecast routing graph. Thus, energy efficiency is ensured. We describe in details the functioning of $Wave$, highlighting its features (e.g. support of heterogeneous traffic, support of a sink equipped with multiple interfaces) and properties in terms of worst case delays and buffer size. We discuss 
%its features with regard to a centralized scheduling algorithm like $TMCP$ and a distributed one like $DeTAS$. Simulation results show the good performance of $Wave$ compared to $TMCP$. Since in an industrial environment, several routing graphs can coexist, we study how $Wave$ supports this coexistence.

\subsection{Centralized Scheduling in TSCH-based Wireless Sensor Networks}

\begin{participants}

\end{participants}

Scheduling in an IEEE802.15.4e TSCH(Time Slotted Channel Hopping 6TiSCH) low-power wireless network can be done in a centralized or distributed way. 
When using centralized scheduling, a scheduler installs a communication schedule into the network.
This can be done in a standards-based way using CoAP.
In this study, we compute the number of packets and the latency this takes, on real-world examples.
The result is that the cost is very high using today's standards, much higher than when using an ad-hoc solution such as OCARI.
We conclude by making recommendations to drastically reduce the number of messages and improve the efficiency of the standardized approach.

In 2016, we studied two types of deployment for wireless sensor networks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item those ensuring full area coverage and network connectivity;
    \item those covering some given Points of Interest (PoI) and ensuring network connectivity.\\
\end{itemize}

Deployment of sensor nodes to fully cover an area has caught the interest of many researchers.
However, some simplifying assumptions are adopted such as the knowledge of obstacles, a centralized algorithm...
To cope with these drawbacks, we propose OA-DVFA (Obstacles Avoidance Distributed Virtual Forces Algorithm), a self-deployment algorithm to ensure full area coverage and network connectivity.
This fully distributed algorithm is based on virtual forces to move sensor nodes.
We show how to avoid the problem of node oscillations and to detect the end of the deployment in a distributed way. 
We evaluate the impact of the number, shape and position of obstacles on the coverage rate, the distance traveled by all nodes and the number of active nodes.
Simulation results show the very good behavior of OA-DVFA.
This work done in collaboration with Anis Laouiti has been presented at the CCNC 2016 conference.

We also focus on wireless sensor networks deployed to cover some given Points of Interest (PoIs), achieve connectivity with the sink and be robust against link and node failures. 
The Relay Node Placement problem (RNP) consists in minimizing the number of relays needed and the maximum length of the paths connecting each PoI with the sink. 
We propose a solution that determines the positions of relay nodes based on the virtual grid computed by the optimal deployment for full area coverage.
We compare our solution with two different solutions based respectively on
(1) the straight line that builds the shortest path between each PoI and the sink,
(2) the Steiner point that connects PoIs together.
We then extend these algorithms to achieve k-connectivity.
Our solution outperforms the Steiner points solution in terms of maximum path length on the one hand, and the straight line solution in terms of total number of relay nodes deployed on the other hand.
We also apply our solution in an area containing obstacles and show that it provides very good performances.
This study has been presented at the MASS 2016 conference.

Mobile wireless nodes in charge of collecting data from static wireless sensor nodes constitute a very attractive solution for wireless sensor networks, WSNs, where the application requirements in terms of node autonomy are very strong unlike the requirement in terms of latency.
Mobile nodes allow wireless sensor nodes to save energy.

In 2016 we focused on the path planning problem of mobile wireless nodes gathering data according two different objectives:

\begin{itemize}
    \item to ensure the monitoring of a given area;
    \item to visit some given Points of Interest (PoI) in a delay less than a given latency.
\end{itemize}

For the first objective, we are interested in area monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
Basically, we propose a path planning approach for area monitoring where UAVs are considered as mobile collectors.
The area to be monitored is divided into cells.
The goal is to determine the path of each UAV such that each cell is covered by exactly one UAV, fairness is ensured in terms of the number of cells visited by each UAV and the path of each UAV is minimized.
To meet our goal, we proceed in two steps.
In the first step, we assign to each UAV the cells to visit.
In the second step, we optimize the path of each UAV visiting its cells.
For the first step, we propose two solutions.
The first solution is based on cluster formation, each cluster is made up of the set of cells monitored by a same UAV.
The second solution is based on game theory and uses coalition formation to determine the cells to be monitored by each UAV.
In the second step and for both solutions, we propose to apply optimization techniques to minimize the path of each UAV that visits all its cells.
This study done in collaboration with Nadjib Achir 
was presented at the PEMWN 2016 conference.

For the second objective, we use game theory to model the problem.
Game theory is often used to find equilibria where no player can unilaterally increase its own payoff by changing its strategy without changing the strategies of other players.
In this paper, we propose to use coalition formation to compute the optimized tours of mobile sinks in charge of collecting data from static wireless sensor nodes.
The associated coalition formation problem has a stable solution given by the final partition obtained.
However, the order in which the players play has a major impact on the final result.
We determine the best order to minimize the number of mobile sinks needed.
We evaluate the complexity of this coalition game in terms of the number of rounds and the processing time needed to get convergence, as well as the impact of the number of collect points on the number of mobile sinks needed and on the maximum tour duration of these mobile sinks.
In addition, we show how to extend the coalition game to support different latencies for different types of data.
Finally, we formalize our problem as a multi-objective optimization problem.
We compare the coalition game with a genetic algorithm: for 20 nodes to visit, the coalition game requires a processing time 327 times less than the genetic algorithm.
The coalition game provides a scalable solution.
These results have been presented at the IPCCC 2016 conference.

Most wireless sensor networks that are currently deployed use a technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, this standard does not meet all requirements of industrial applications in terms of latency, throughput and robustness. That is why the IEEE 802.15.4e amendment has been designed, including the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode.

In 2016, we evaluated the time needed for a joining node to detect beacons advertising the TSCH network. This time may be long due to channel hopping in the TSCH network. The beacon advertising policy is left unspecified by the standard. We propose DBA, a Deterministic Beacon Advertising algorithm. DBA ensures a collision-free and regular transmission of beacons on all the frequencies used by the TSCH network. DBA outperforms two solutions already published that are Random Horizontal and Random Vertical. Some results have been presented as a poster at the IPCCC 2016 conference.

The medium access in a TSCH network is ruled by a schedule that determines for each pair (slot offset, channel offset) the transmitting node(s) and the receiving node(s). Each node in the TSCH network must have this schedule. The question is how to install it on all nodes. We proposed and evaluated different ways of installing a schedule in a TSCH network, comparing them in terms of the number of messages required. This study has been presented at the AdHoc Now 2016 conference.

Wireless Sensor Networks and Industrial Internet
of Things use smart, autonomous and usually limited capacity
devices in order to sense and monitor industrial environments.
The devices in a wireless sensor network are managed by a
controller, which should authenticate them before they join
the network. OCARI is a wireless sensor network technology
providing optimized protocols in order to reduce the energy
consumption.\\ 

To enhance OCARI security and ensure a robust
authentication of devices, we propose a strong authentication
method based on the One Time Password algorithm and deployed
at the MAC layer. This method is specially designed to
be implemented on devices with low storage and computing
capacities.
This work has been done in collaboration with Mohammed Tahar Hammi from Telecom ParisTech and presented at the PEMWN 2016 conference.\\

We also evaluated the performances of the building of an OCARI network. The goal was to identify the most time consuming steps among node association, neighborhood discovery, routing tree building, stabilization of the routing tree and node coloring.\\

Sensor networks are often used to collect data from the environment where they are located. These data can then be transmitted regularly to a special node called a {\em sink}, which can be fixed or mobile. For critical data (like military or medical data), it is important that sinks and simple sensors can mutually authenticate so as to avoid data to be collected and/or accessed by fake nodes.
For some applications, the collection frequency can be very high. As a result, the authentication mechanism used between a node and a sink must be fast and efficient both in terms of calculation time and energy consumption. This is especially important for nodes which computing capabilities and battery lifetime are very low. Moreover, an extra effort has been done to develop alternative solutions to secure, authenticate, and ensure the confidentiality of sensors, and the distribution of keys in the sensor network. Specific researches have also been conducted for large-scale sensors. At present, we work on an exchange protocol between sensors and sinks based on low-cost shifts and xor operations. This study was published in~\cite{boumerdassi:hal-01251917}. After this publication, we have been working on the performance evaluation of the solution to determine the memory overhead together with both computing and communication latencies.

This work is a collaboration with M\'erouane Debbah (Supelec, France).

The objective of this work is to propose a framework for massive MIMO cooperative communications for Wireless Sensor Networks. Our main objective is  to analyze the performances of the deployment of a large number of sensors. This deployment should cope with a high demand for real time monitoring and should also take into account energy consumption. We have assumed a communication protocol with two phases: an initial training period followed by a second transmit period. The first period allows the sensors to estimate the channel state and the objective of the second period is to transmit the data sensed. We start analyzing the impact of the time devoted to each period. We study the throughput obtained with respect to the number of sensors when there is one sink. We also compute the optimal number of sinks with respect to the energy spent for different values of sensors. This work is a first step to establish a complete framework to study energy efficient Wireless Sensor Networks where the sensors collaborate to send information to a sink. Currently, we are exploring the multi-hop case.

Machine learning techniques can be used to improve the quality of experience for the end users of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). In a CDN, the most popular video contents are cached near the end-users in order to minimize the contents delivery latency. The idea developed hereafter consists in using prediction techniques to evaluate the future popularity of video contents in order to decide which ones should be cached. The popularity of a video content is evaluated by the number of daily requests for this content.

We consider various prediction methods, called experts, coming from different fields (e.g. statistics, control theory). To evaluate the accuracy of the experts' popularity predictions, we assess these experts according to three criteria: cumulated loss, maximum instantaneous loss and best ranking. The loss function expresses the discrepancy between the prediction value and the real number of requests. We use real traces extracted from YouTube to compare different prediction methods and determine the best tuning of their parameters. The goal is to find the best trade-off between complexity and accuracy of the prediction methods used.

We also show the importance of a decision maker, called forecaster, that predicts the popularity based on the predictions of selection of several experts. The forecaster based on the best K experts outperforms in terms of cumulated loss the individual experts' predictions and those of the forecaster based on only one expert, even if this expert varies over time. This study has been presented at the IWCMC 2016 conference.

In the paper presented at the WiMob 2016 conference, we apply these prediction methods to caching. We first selected the best experts in charge of predicting the popularity of video
contents in real traces of YouTube. We tuned the parameters of the DES expert. We proved that the well-known LFU caching strategy can also be considered as a prediction based strategy
on the Basic expert. Simulation results show that the DES prediction-based caching strategy provides similar Hit Ratio to the well-known LFU caching strategy. These results are usually close to the optimal ones that can be achieved only when knowing in advance the popularity
of each video content for the next day, which is an unrealistic assumption. The exception occurs when a content whose popularity was very poor becomes suddenly very popular with millions of solicitations. In such a case, the accuracy of prediction methods becomes poor. This opens a research direction where the knowledge of societal events is taken into account to improve the prediction.

\subsubsection{An Infrastructure-Free Slot Assignment Algorithm for Reliable Broadcast of Periodic Messages in VANETs}\label{ch:DTMAC}

\begin{participants}
    \pers{Mohamed}{Hadded}
    \pers{Paul}{Muhlethaler}
    \pers{Anis}{Laouiti}
\end{participants}

We have designed a novel \textbf{D}istributed \textbf{T}DMA based \textbf{MAC} protocol, named DTMAC, developed specifically for a highway scenario. DTMAC is designed 
to provide the efficient delivery of both periodic and event-driven safety messages. The protocol uses the vehicles' location and a new slot 
reuse concept to ensure that vehicles in adjacent areas have a collision-free schedule. Simulation results and analysis in a highway 
scenario have been carried out to evaluate the performance of DTMAC and compare it with the VeMAC protocol.

We propose a completely distributed and infrastructure free TDMA scheduling scheme which exploits the linear feature of VANET 
topologies. The vehicles' movements in a highway environment are linear due to the fact that their movements are constrained 
by the road topology. Our scheduling mechanism is also based on the assumption that each road is divided into $N$ small fixed 
areas, denoted by $x_i, i=1,\ldots,N$ (see Figure~\ref{figc:DTMAC_idea}). Area IDs can be easily derived using map and GPS 
Information.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \end{center}
    \caption{TDMA slots scheduling principle.}
    \label{figc:DTMAC_idea}
\end{figure}

The time slots in each TDMA frame are partitioned into three sets $S_0, S_1$ and $S_2$ associated with vehicles in three 
contiguous areas: $x_i, x_{i+1}$ and $x_{i+2}$, respectively (see Figure~\ref{figc:DTMAC_idea}). Each frame consists of a 
constant number of time slots, denoted by $\tau$ and each time slot is of a fixed time duration, denoted by $s$. Each vehicle 
can detect the start time of each frame as well as the start time of a time slot. In the VANET studied, all the vehicles are 
equipped with a GPS and thus the one-Pulse-Per-Second (1PPS) signal that a GPS receiver gets from GPS 
satellites can be used for slot synchronization. 

To prevent collisions on the transmission channel, our TDMA scheduling mechanism requires that every packet transmitted by 
any vehicle must contain additional information, called Frame Information (FI).
For the frame, this field gives the status of the slot (Idle, Busy, Collision) and 
the ID of the vehicles accessing each slot with the characteristic of the data 
sent: periodic or event-driven safety messages.

%The FI consists of a set of ID Fields (IDFs) of 
%size equal to the number of time slots per frame, $\tau$. Each IDF is dedicated to the corresponding time slot of a frame. The 
%basic FI structure is shown in Figure~\ref{figc:DTMAC_Frame}.
%Each time slot is dynamically reserved by an active vehicle 
%(the vehicle whose communication device is transmitting) for collision-free delivery of safety messages or other control messages.
%The VC\_ID field contains the ID of the vehicle that is accessing this slot. Each vehicle is identified by its MAC address. The 
%SLT\_STS field contains the status of each slot which indicates whether the slot is Idle, Busy or in Collision. Finally, the 
%PKT\_TYP field indicates the type of packet transmitted by the vehicle, i.e. periodic information or event-driven safety messages.

%Our distributed TDMA scheduling mechanism uses vehicles location and slot reuse concept to ensure that vehicles in 
%adjacent areas have collision-free schedule. The channel time is partitioned into frames and each frame is further 
%partitioned into three sets of time slots $S_0, S_1,$ and $S_2$ of size equal to $n1, n2~$and$~n3$, respectively. These sets 
%are associated with vehicles moving in the areas $x_i,~x_{i+1},~$and$~x_{i+2}$, respectively. As shown in 
%Figure~\ref{figc:DTMAC_idea}, by dividing the time slots into three sets, vehicles $v_1$ and $v_3$ that are moving 
%within the two areas $x_1$ and $x_3$, respectively, can not transmit simultaneously to  vehicle $v_2$ because they 
%are accessing disjoint sets of time slots. Therefore, our TDMA scheduling mechanism can decrease the collisions rate 
%caused by the hidden node problem. In each area, the vehicles access the time slots associated to their locations 
%with the same probability. In the rest of this chapter, we adopt the following notations:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $S_{j}(v)$: The set of time slots associated to the area in which the vehicle $v$ is traveling. \vspace{1mm}
%\item $N(v)$: The set of neighbors\footnote{The set of neighbors is the set of vehicles that are moving within the same area.} of vehicle $v$ on the transmission channel. \vspace{1mm}
%\end{itemize}
%Every active vehicle in the network should be allocated a fixed slot in the frame for safety messages or other control 
%packet transmissions. It is obvious that a vehicle's slot cannot be used by any neighboring vehicles within the same area or in  adjacent areas, otherwise collisions will occur. The goal of this work is to propose an efficient slot reuse algorithm  without having to use expensive spectrum and complex broadband mechanisms such as FDMA or CDMA. In fact, the three subsets of time slots will be reused between neighboring areas in such a way no vehicle in different adjacent areas can access the channel at the same time, and thus no interference will occur. 
%
%
%Let us suppose that an active vehicle $v$ moving within the area $x_i$ needs to acquire a time slot on the transmission channel. Vehicle $v$ starts listening to the channel during the set of time slots reserved for the area in which it is traveling, let $S_{j}(v)$, where $j=(i+2)~mod~3$.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Each vehicle that hears exactly one node transmission in a time slot reserved for its location, will set the status 
%of the slot to ''busy'' and record the ID of the vehicle accessing the channel in this time slot in the corresponding VC\_ID field.
%%\item Each vehicle that hears multiple FIs from different vehicles during the same time slot, will consider that the slot is occupied by more than one vehicle and sets its status to collision.
%\item If a vehicle does not hear anything during a specific time slot, it will set its status to ''free'' in the FI.
%\item If a vehicle can not decode the data during a specific time slot, it will set its status to ''collision'' in the FI.
%\item When a vehicle A has sent data in a given slot, it looks in the field information of the next slots to 
%discover whether its neighbors 
%have correctly received its data. If a neighbor of A reports  collision for this slot  (in the FI) or even if this slot is reported 
%to be ''busy'' 
%but being sent by another node (say B in the VC\_ID), A considers that its transmission has led to a 
%collision\footnote{Actually a node A considers that its transmission is a success if and only if all its neighbors 
%report a success in the FI of their slots specifying that the data was sent by node A.}. 
%\end{itemize}
%
%At the end of the frame the vehicle $v$ can determine the set $N(v)$ and the set of busy slots in $S_{j}(v)$ used by each 
%vehicle $u\in N(v)$, denoted by $B(v)$. In order to avoid any collision problem, this set of time slots can not be used by 
%any neighboring vehicles. Therefore,  vehicle $v$ can determine the set of available time slots $F(v)$ and then attempts to 
%select one of them at random, say time slot $k$.

The simulation results show that, compared to VeMAC which is the reference in terms of TDMA protocols for VANETs, DTMAC provides a lower rate of access and merging collisions, which results in significantly improved broadcast coverage. For further details see~\cite{hadded:hal-01379216}.

\subsubsection{TRPM: a TDMA-aware routing protocol for multi-hop communications in VANETs}

\begin{participants}
    \pers{Mohamed}{Elhadad or Hadded}
    \pers{Paul}{Muhlethaler}
    \pers{Anis}{Laouiti}
\end{participants}

The main idea of TRPM is to select the next hop using the vehicle position and the time 
slot information from the TDMA scheduling.  Like the GPSR protocol, we assume that each transmitting vehicle 
knows the position of the packet's destination. In TRPM, the TDMA scheduling information and the position of a packet's destination 
are sufficient to make correct forwarding decisions at each transmitting vehicle. Specifically, if a  source vehicle is moving in 
area $x_i$, the locally optimal choice of next hop is the neighbor geographically located in area $x_{i+1}$ or $x_{i-1}$ according 
to the position of the packet's destination. As a result, the TDMA slot scheduling obtained by DTMAC  can be used to determine the 
set of next hops that are geographically closer to the destination. In fact, each vehicle that is moving in the area $x_i$ can 
know the locally optimal set of next hops that are located in adjacent areas $x_{i+1}$ or $x_{i-1}$ by observing the set of time 
slots $S_{(i+3)\%3}$ or $S_{(i+1)\%3}$, respectively. We consider the same example presented above when vehicle G as the destination 
vehicle that will broadcast a message received from vehicle A. As shown in Figure~\ref{figc:trpm}, only two relay vehicles are needed to ensure a 
multi-hop path between vehicle A and G (one relay node in the area $x_2$ and another one in the area $x_3$). 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
        \includegraphics[height=9cm,width=15cm]{IMG/TRPM.jpg}
        \caption{VANET network using DTMAC scheduling scheme.}
        \label{figc:trpm}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

In the following, the DTMAC protocol has been used by the vehicles to organize the channel access. The TDMA slot 
scheduling obtained by DTMAC is illustrated in Figure \ref{figc:trpm}. Firstly, vehicle A forwards a packet to B, as  vehicle A uses its frame 
information to choose a vehicle that is accessing the channel during the set $S_1$. Upon receiving the packet for forwarding, vehicle B 
will choose by using its frame information a vehicle that's accessing the channel during the set of time slots $S_2$ 
(say vehicle D). Then, vehicle D will forward the packet to G, as G is moving in area $x_4$ (accessing the channel during the 
set $S_0$) and it is the direct neighbor of vehicle D. By using DTMAC as the MAC layer, we can note that the path A-B-D-G is 
the shortest, in terms of the number of hops as well as the end-to-end delay which  is equal to 6 time slots  (2 time slots 
between $t_0$ and $t_2$ as $t_2$ is the transmission slot for vehicle B, then 2 time slots between $t_2$ and $t_4$ as $t_4$ is the 
transmission slot for vehicle D and finally 2 time slots between $t_4$ and $t_0$ as $t_0$ is the transmission slot in which vehicle 
G will broadcast the message received from  vehicle A). 

%%Packet forwarding algorithm

The idea of TRPM is the following. Whenever a vehicle $i$ accessing the channel during the set $S_k$ wants to send/forward an 
event-driven safety message, it constructs two sets of candidate forwarders based on its frame information FI as 
follows, where $TS(j)$ indicates the time slot reserved by vehicle $j$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A_i=\{j\in N(i)~|~TS(j)\in S_{(k+1)\%3}\}$ // \textit{The set of vehicles that are moving in the adjacent right-hand area.}
    \item $B_i=\{j\in N(i)~|~TS(j)\in S_{(k+2)\%3}\}$ // \textit{The set of vehicles that are moving in the adjacent left-hand area.}
\end{itemize}

Each source vehicle uses the position of a packet's destination and the TDMA scheduling information to make packet forwarding 
decisions. In fact, when a source vehicle $i$ is moving behind the destination vehicle, it will select a next hop relay that 
belongs to set $B_i$; when the transmitter is moving in front of the destination vehicle, it will select a forwarder vehicle 
from those in  set $A_i$. %Algorithm~\ref{ALGO1} outlines the behavior of our scheme during the procedure for sending an event-driven safety messages. 
For each vehicle $i$ that will send or forward a message, we define the normalized weight function WHS (Weighted next-Hop 
Selection) which depends on the delay and the distance between each neighboring vehicle $j$. WHS is calculated as follows:

\begin{center}
    \vspace{2mm}
    $WHS_{i,j}=\alpha*\frac{\Delta t_{i,j}}{\tau}-(1-\alpha)*\frac{d_{i,j}}{R}~~~~~~(1)$ 
    \vspace{2mm}
\end{center}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\tau$ is the length of the TDMA frame (in number of time slots).
    \item $j$ is one of the neighbors of vehicle $i$, which represents the potential next hop that will relay the message received from vehicle $i$.
    \item $\Delta t_{i,j}$ is the gap between the sending slot of vehicle $i$ and the sending slot of vehicle $j$.
    \item $d_{i,j}$ is the distance between the two vehicles $i$ and $j$, and $R$ is the communication range. 
    \item $\alpha$ is a weighted value in the interval $[0,1]$ that gives more weight to either distance or delay. When $\alpha$ is high, more weight is given to the delay. Otherwise, when $\alpha$ is small, more weight is given to the distance.
\end{itemize}

We note that the two weight factors $\frac{\Delta t_{i,j}}{\tau}$ and $\frac{d_{i,j}}{R}$ are in conflict. For simplicity, we assume 
that all the factors should be minimized. In fact, the multiplication of the second weight factor
by (-1) allows us to transform a maximization to a minimization. Therefore, the forwarding vehicle for $i$ is the 
vehicle $j$ that is moving in an adjacent area for which $WHS_{i,j}$ is the lowest value.

The simulation results reveal that our routing protocol significantly outperforms other
protocols in terms of average end-to-end delay, average number
of relay vehicles and the average delivery ratio.

\subsubsection{CTMAC: a Centralized TDMA for VANETs}

    \pers{Anis}{Laouiti}
\end{participants}
    
We have designed an infrastructure-based TDMA scheduling scheme which exploits the linear feature of VANET topologies. The 
vehicles' movements in a highway environment are linear due to the fact that their movements are constrained by the road topology. Our 
scheduling mechanism is also based on the assumption that the highway is equipped with some RSUs (i.e. one RSU 
for each $2\times R~meters$, where $R$ is the communication range). Note that each area is covered by one RSU installed on 
the side of the highway and in the middle of the corresponding area. The time slots in each TDMA 
frame are partitioned into two sets $S_1, S_2$ associated with vehicles in two adjacent RSU 
areas (see Figure~\ref{fig:CTSA}). Each frame consists of a constant number of time slots, denoted by $\tau$ and each time 
slot is of a fixed time duration, denoted by $s$. Each vehicle can detect the start time of each frame as well as the 
start time of a time slot. 
%In the VANET studied, all the vehicles are equipped with a GPS 
%and thus the one-Pulse-Per-Second (1PPS) signal that a GPS receiver gets from GPS satellites can be used for 
%slot synchronization. The first time slot either in the set $S_1$ or $S_2$ is always used by the correspondent RSU to
%broadcast a Slot Announcement message (SA) to the vehicles within its coverage area. In the following, we detail the slot scheduling mechanism in CTMAC and we show how this protocol can 
%provide an efficient time slot utilization for the participating vehicles, while minimizing transmission collisions caused 
%by the hidden node problem.

        \label{fig:CTSA}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The CTMAC scheduling mechanism uses a slot reuse concept 
to ensure that vehicles in adjacent areas covered by two RSUs have 
a collision-free schedule. The channel time is partitioned into frames and
each frame is further partitioned into two sets of time slots $S_1$ and $S_2$. 
These sets are associated with vehicles moving in the adjacent RSU areas. 
These sets of time slots are reused along the highway in such a way that no vehicles belonging to 
the same set of two-hop 
neighbors using the same time slot. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CTSA}, the vehicles in 
the coverage area of $RSU_1$ and those in the coverage area of $RSU_2$ are
accessing disjoint sets of time slots. As a result, the scheduling mechanism of 
CTMAC can decrease the collision rate by avoiding the inter-RSUs interference 
without using any complex band.  Each active vehicle keeps accessing the same 
time slot on all subsequent frames unless it enters another area covered by another 
RSU or a merging collision problem occurs. Each vehicle uses only its allocated 
time slot to transmit its packet on the control channel.

The simulation results
reveal that CTMAC significantly outperforms the VeMAC and
ADHOC MAC protocols. in terms of transmission collisions
and the overhead required to create and maintain the TDMA
schedules, see~\cite{hadded:hal-01379219}.

%\end{figure}
%
%In CTMAC, each RSU constructs and maintains a Frame Information (FI) 
%of length equal to the number of time slots per frame, $\tau$. 
%For the frame, this field gives the status of the slot (Idle, Busy, Collision) and 
%the ID of the vehicles accessing each slot with the characteristic of the data 
%sent: periodic or event-driven safety messages. 
%
%The FI consists 
%of a set of ID Fields (IDFs) and each one is dedicated to the corresponding 
%time slot of a frame. The FI structure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CTSA_FI}. 
%Each IDF consists of three fields: VC\_ID, SLT\_STS and PKT\_TYP. 
%The VC\_ID field contains the ID of the vehicle that is accessing this slot. 
%The SLT\_STS field contains the status of each slot which indicates whether 
%the slot is Idle, Busy or in Collision. Finally, the PKT\_TYP field indicates 
%the type of packet transmitted by the vehicle, i.e. periodic information or 
%event-driven safety messages. Unlike the VeMAC and ADHOC MAC 
%protocols, in the CTMAC protocol, only the RSU nodes periodically 
%broadcast their frame information and each vehicle will update its frame
% information based on the packet transmitted by its RSU. However, a 
% vehicle broadcasts its frame information only when an access collision problem is detected. 
%
%At the end of each frame, each RSU $u$ can determine the set of 
%free time slots based on its frame information, denoted by $F(u)$. 
%When an RSU has one or more available time slots, it announces that 
%by broadcasting a Slot Announcement (SA) message containing its 
%identity $(SA->NODE\_ID)$ to all the vehicles in its coverage area.

%When a vehicle receives 
%an SA message, and if it wishes to access the channel, it tries to get the 
%%attention of the RSU by sending it a Slot REQuest message (SREQ) including its identity. Algorithm~\ref{SlotReservation} outlines the details of the slot 
%%reservation mechanism.
% $v$ represents the vehicle that needs to reserve a 
%time slot, $timer_1$ is a timer and $TS(v)$ is the time slot that is successfully 
%acquired by vehicle $v$. When an RSU receives the SERQ message, it checks 
%whether there is an available time slot and, if there is, the RSU sends a Slot REPly 
%message (SREP) to the corresponding vehicle including the slot index $(SREP->SLT\_ID)$. 
%After the reception of the SREP, the vehicle $v$ starts to broadcast its message 
%during its time slot, $TS(v)=SREP->SLT\_ID$. Otherwise, if the timer expires and 
%no response has been received from the RSU (lines 12-14), the vehicle $v$ will repeat the same steps.
%If a vehicle receives an SA message from another RSU (line 17), the vehicle 
%will send an SREQ to allocate a new time slot and if it receives an SREP from 
%the RSU it will release its current time slot and it will start to broadcast its packet 
%during the time slot allocated by the new RSU. Moreover, when an RSU does 
%not receive a message from a vehicle $v$ during its slot, it considers that it has 
%left its coverage area and it releases its time slot.

\subsubsection{A Flooding-Based Location Service in VANETs}

\end{participants}

We have designed and analyzed a location service for VANETs; 
such a service can be used in Location-based routing protocols for 
VANETs. Our protocol is  a proactive
flooding-based location service that drastically reduces the
number of update packets sent over the network as compared to
traditional flooding-based location services. This goal is achieved
by partially forwarding location information at each node. A
mathematical model and some simulations are proposed to show
the effectiveness of this solution. Cases for 1D, 2D and 3D spaces
are studied for both deterministic and probabilistic forwarding
decisions. We compare our protocol with the Multi-Point Relay (MPR) 
technique which is used in the OLSR protocol and determine the best  technique 
according to the network conditions.

\subsubsection{Performance analysis of IEEE 802.11 broadcast schemes with different inter-frame spacings}

\begin{participants}

\end{participants}

We have started to build a model which analyzes the performance 
of IEEE 802.11p managing different classes of priorities. 
The differentiation of traffic streams is obtained with different 
inter-frame spacings:  AIFSs (for Arbitration Inter Frame Spacings) and with 
different back-off windows: CWs (for Collision Windows). 
This model is based on a Markov model where the state is the remaining 
number of idle slots that a packet of a given class has to wait before transmission. 
However, in addition to this Markov model for which we compute a steady state 
we also consider the Markov chain which counts the number of idle slots after 
the smallest AIFS. As a matter of fact the probability these states are not evenly 
distributed since with different AIFSs the arrival rate is not constant 
when the number of idle slots experienced after the smallest AIFS varies. 
The resolution of the steady state of these two inter-mixed Markov chains
lead to non linear and intertwined equations that can be easily  solved with a software 
such as Maple. 
With the model we have obtained, we can compute the delivery rate 
of packets of different classes and show the influence of system parameters: 
AIFSs and CWs. The preliminary results show a a very strong influence 
of different AIFSs on the performance for each traffic streams.

\subsubsection{Model of IEEE 802.11 Broadcast Scheme with Infinite Queue}

\begin{participants}
    \pers{Guy}{Fayolle}
    \pers{Paul}{Muhlethaler}
\end{participants}

We have analyzed the so-called back-off technique of the IEEE 802.11 protocol
in broadcast mode with waiting queues. In contrast to existing models, packets arriving when a
station (or node) is in back-off state are not discarded, but are stored in a buffer of infinite capacity.
As in previous studies, the key point of our analysis hinges on the assumption that the time on
the channel is viewed as a random succession of transmission slots (whose duration corresponds
to the length of a packet) and mini-slots during which the back-off of the station is decremented.
These events occur independently, with given probabilities. The state of a node is represented by a
two-dimensional Markov chain in discrete-time, formed by the back-off counter and the number of
packets at the station. Two models are proposed both of which are shown to cope reasonably well
with the physical principles of the protocol. The stability (ergodicity) conditions are obtained and
interpreted in terms of maximum throughput. Several approximations related to these models are
also discussed. The results of this study are in \cite{fayolle:hal-01166082}.

\subsubsection{Model and optimization of CSMA}

\end{participants}

We have studied  the maximum throughput of CSMA in scenarios with spatial reuse.
The nodes of our network form a Poisson Point Process (PPP) of a one- or two-dimensional space.
The one-dimensional PPP well represents VANETs.
To model the effect of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), we give random marks to our nodes and to elect transmitting nodes in the PPP we choose the nodes with the smallest marks in their neighborhood, this is the Matern hardcore selection process.
To describe the signal propagation, we use a signal with power-law decay and we add a random Rayleigh fading.
To decide whether or not a transmission is successful, we adopt the Signal-over-Interference Ratio (SIR) model in which a packet is correctly received if its transmission power divided by the interference power is above a capture threshold.
We assume that each node in our PPP has a random receiver at a typical distance.
We choose the average distance to its closest neighbor.
We also assume that all the network nodes always have a pending packet.
With these assumptions, we analytically study the density of throughput of successful transmissions and we show that it can be optimized with the carrier-sense threshold. 
 The model makes it possible to analytically compute the 
 performance of a CSMA system and gives 
 interesting results on the network performance such as the capture probability 
 when the throughput is optimized, and the effect on a non-optimization of the 
 carrier sense threshold on the throughput. We can also study the influence 
of the parameters and  see their effects on the overall performance. 
We observe a significant difference between 2D an 1D networks.

We have built two models  to compare the spatial density of successful 
transmissions of CSMA and Aloha. 
To carry out a  fair comparison, we optimize both schemes by adjusting their parameters. 
For spatial Aloha, we can adapt the 
transmission probability, whereas for spatial CSMA we have to find the suitable carrier sense threshold. The results obtained show that CSMA, when optimized, outperforms Aloha 
for nearly all the parameters of the network model values 
and we evaluate the gain of CSMA over Aloha. 
We also find interesting results concerning the effect of the model parameters on the performance 
of both Aloha and CSMA. 
The closed formulas we have obtained provide immediate evaluation of performance, whereas 
simulations may take minutes to give their results. Even if Aloha and CSMA are not recent protocols, 
this comparison of spatial performance is new and provides interesting and useful results. 

For Aloha networks, when we study transmissions over the average distance to the closest 
neighbor, the optimization does not depend on the density of nodes, 
which is a very interesting property. Thus in Aloha networks, the density of 
successful transmissions easily scales linearly in $\lambda$ when we vary 
$\lambda$ whereas in CSMA networks the protocol must be carefully 
tuned to obtain this scaling.

\subsubsection{Adaptive CSMA}

\begin{participants}
     \pers{Nadjib}{Achir}
    \pers{Younes}{Bouchaala}
    \pers{Paul}{Muhlethaler}
    \pers{Oyunchimeg}{Shagdar}
\end{participants}

Using the model we have built for CSMA, we have shown that when optimized 
with the carrier sense detection threshold $P_{cs}$, 
the probability $p^*$ of transmission for a node 
in the CSMA network does not depend on the density of nodes $\lambda$. 
In other words when the CSMA is optimized to obtain the largest density of successful 
transmissions (communication from nodes to their neighbors), $p^*$  is constant.
We have verified this statement 
on several examples and we think that a formal proof of this remark is possible using 
scaling  arguments. The average access delay is a direct function of the probability of transmission $p$. Thus the average delay when the carrier sense detection threshold is optimized 
is a constant $D_{target}$ which does not depend on $\lambda$. 
A stabilization algorithm which 
adapts $P_{cs}$ to reach the $D_{target}$ can thus be envisioned.

%We propose two analytically tractable stochastic-geometric models of interference in adhoc
%networks using pure (non-slotted) Aloha as the medium access. In contrast the slotted model, the interference in
%pure Aloha may vary during the transmission of a tagged
%packet. We develop closed form expressions for the Laplace
%transform of the empirical average of the interference
%experienced during the transmission of a typical packet.
%Both models assume a power-law path-loss function with
%arbitrarily distributed fading and feature configurations
%of transmitters randomly located in the Euclidean plane
%according to a Poisson point process. Depending on the
%model, these configurations vary over time or are static. We
%apply our analysis of the interference to study the Signal-to-
%Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) outage probability for
%a typical transmission in pure Aloha. The results are used
%to compare the performance of non-slotted Aloha to the
%slotted one, which has almost exclusively been previously

%
%\begin{participants}

%\end{participants}
%
%We study a stationary Poisson
%pattern of nodes on a line embedded in an independent planar
%Poisson field of interfering nodes. Assuming slotted Aloha and
%the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio capture condition, with
%the usual power-law path loss model and Rayleigh fading, we
%explicitly evaluate several local and end-to-end performance
%characteristics related to the nearest-neighbor packet relaying on
%this line, and study their dependence on the model parameters
%(the density of relaying and interfering nodes, Aloha tuning and
%the external noise power). Our model can be applied in two cases:
%the first use is for vehicular ad-hoc networks, where vehicles are
%randomly located on a straight road. The second use is to study
%a “typical” route traced in a (general) planar ad-hoc network by
%some routing mechanism. The approach we have chosen allows
%us to quantify the non-efficiency of long-distance routing in “pure
%ad-hoc” networks and evaluate a possible remedy for it in the
%form of additional “fixed” relaying nodes, called road-side units in
%a vehicular network. It also allows us to consider a more general
%field of interfering nodes and study the impact of the clustering
%of its nodes on the routing performance. As a special case of
%a field with more clustering than the Poison field, we consider
%a Poisson-line field of interfering nodes, in which all the nodes
%are randomly located on random straight lines. In this case our
%analysis rigorously (in the sense of Palm theory) corresponds to
%the typical route of this network. The comparison to our basic
%model reveals a paradox: clustering of interfering nodes decreases
%the outage probability of a single (typical) transmission on the
%route, but increases the mean end-to-end delay

The Cluster CONNEXION (Digital Command Control for Nuclear EXport and renovatION) project aims to propose and validate an innovative architecture platforms suitable control systems for nuclear power plants in France and abroad. This architecture integrates a set of technological components developed by the academic partners (CEA, Inria, CNRS / CRAN, ENS Cachan, LIG, Telecom ParisTech) and based on collaborations between major integrators such as ALSTOM and AREVA, the operator EDF in France and ``techno-providers'' of embedded software (Atos WorldGrid, Rolls-Royce Civil Nuclear, Corys TESS, Esterel Technologies, All4Tec, Predict).
With the support of the competitiveness clusters System@tic, Minalogic and Burgundy Nuclear Partnership,the project started in April 2012. The key deliverables of the project covered several topics related demonstration concern-driven engineering models for the design and validation of large technical systems, design environments and evaluation of HMI, the implementation of Wireless Sensor Network context-nuclear, buses business object or real-time middleware facilitating the exchange of heterogeneous data and distributed data models standardized to ensure consistency of digital systems. 

The EVA team focuses more particularly on the interconnection of the OCARI wireless sensor network with the industrial facility backbone and deployment algorithms of wireless sensors.

In the Cluster Connexion project, the goal for the EVA team was to design and implement new functionnalities for the OCARI wireless sensor network to allow it to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item support the mobility of some sensor nodes (targeted application: remote dosimetry to monitor the exposition of people to radiations), 
    \item transmit commands to sensors/actuators (e.g. configuration parameters, regeneration order),
    \item ensure data gathering during node recoloring,  
    \item remotely manage the parameters of the OCARI network,
    \item aggregate in a single frame several heterogeneous measures originated from different sensors on a same wireless node, 
    \item use a generic format for the measures: type, length, value.
    \item integrate this network to the middleware of context-aware services, OPC-UA/ROSA. 
\end{itemize}

The demonstrator ``a mobile connected worksite''  developed in the Cluster Connexion project meets several objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the wireless sensor networks more reliable in an  ionisating environment ionisant;
    \item Make easier the diagnostic and the repairing by means of the aggregation of data originated from heterogeneous sources; 
    \item Take into account the requirements of information security in the architectures;
    \item Ensure a continuum of solutions for the industrial involved.\\
\end{itemize}

The Industrial IoT (Internet of Things) solution proposed by Connexion is an integrated chain, from the wireless sensor\& actuator network up to the surveillance, diagnostic and health infrastructure monitoring applications, using a context-aware middleware fitting the industrial environment.\\ 

At the end of the Cluster Connexion project, we made the demonstration of a command/control loop for the regeneration of wireless sensor nodes in collaboration with CEA, Predict, Telecom ParisTech, EDF, ATOS and Inria highlighting the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the upstream flow of health indicators from electronic devices,
    \item detection of an abnormal behavior by a monitoring software (KASEM),  
    \item generation of a regeneration command and transmission of this command to the misbehaving sensor node.
    \item regeneration of the involved sensor
    \item insertion of the regenerated sensor in the OCARI network.\\
\end{itemize}

When the Cluster Connexion project ended, the results obtained with regard to the OCARI network and the OPC-UA/ROSA middleware have been transferred to the Task Force ConnexSensors hosted by AFNeT. The goals of the ConnexSensors TaskForce are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Federate industrial companies around an IoT solution IoT including wireless sensor \& actuator networks and a standardized industrial middleware.
    \item Jointly valorize the OCARI wireless sensor \& actuator network and the OPC-UA/ROSA middleware.
    \item Deploy the Connexion demonstrator in the basemenet of interested industrials. 
    \item Ensure that industrials will keep the mastership of their data. 
    \item Ensure the perennity of the solution proposed.\\

    \item Type: Associate Team
    \item Inria International Lab: Inria@SiliconValley
    \item Associate teams: Inria-EVA, Prof. Glaser's team (UC Berkeley), Prof. Kerkez's team (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)
    \item Duration: 2015-2017
    \item Objective:
        Prof. Glaser's and Prof. Kerkez's teams are revolutionizing environmental monitoring by using low power wireless TSCH networks to produce continuous environmental data accessible in real time.
        They are successfully deploying these networks to study mountain hydrology, observe water quality in urban watersheds, and build intelligent urban stormwater grids.
        The REALMS associate team conducts research across the environmental engineering and networking research domains.
        Its 3-year goal is to develop easy-to-use real-world network monitoring solutions to provide real-time data for environmental and urban applications.
        This goal leads to the following objectives: building a long-term large-scale public connectivity dataset of the networks deployed; using that dataset to model TSCH networks; and building an ecosystem of tools around this technology.

 \end{itemize}
 \item Start year: 2015 \item See also: \url{http://glaser.berkeley.edu et http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bkerkez/}
 \item La révolution de l'Internet des objets a suscité le développement de nouveaux produits et standards; Le standard IEEE802.15.4e (2012) a introduit le saut de fréquences en temps slotté (TSCH) qui peut assurer une fiabilité de bout-en-bout de 99,999\%Â§ et une autonomie énergétique de plusieurs années. Ces performances exceptionnelles ont suscité la création à l'IETF du groupe de travail 6TISCH pour standardiser l'intégration des réseaux TSCH dans Internet. Alors que les premières données expérimentales ont mis en évidence la grande robustesse de ces réseaux, il n'existe pas de données d'un vrai réseau, accessibles en temps réel, à large échelle et portant sur une longue période. De telles données sont nécessaires pour mieux modéliser les performances du réseau et produire de meilleurs produits et standards. Les équipes des Professeurs Glaser et Kerkez déploient avec succès de tels réseaux pour étudier l'hydrologie en montagne, observer la qualité deb l'eau et gérer les eaux pluviales en environnement urbain. Il manque un modèle pour aider au déploiement et au fonctionnement de ces réseaux, ainsi qu'assurer la surveillance d'un réseau opérationnel.

 \item In 2013, 85\%Â§ of the peach production in the Mendoza region (Argentina) was lost because of frost. Because less fruit was produced in the region, 600.000 less work days were needed to process the harvest between November 201 and March 2014, a reduction in work force of 10.600 people. Across the Mendoza region, frost has caused a loss of revenue of 950 million Argentine pesos - roughly 100 million USD - in the peach business alone.
A frost event happens when the temperature is so low that the crops cannot recover their tissue or internal structure from the effects of water freezing inside or outside the plant. For the peach production, a critical period is when the trees are in bloom and fruit set (Aug./Sept. in Mendoza), during which the temperature needs to be kept above -3°C. Even a few hours below that temperature causes flowers to fall, preventing fruits to grow.
Because of the huge economical impact, countermeasures exist and are used extensively.
Today, virtually all industrial peach orchards are equi
